I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stack, both Back-End, and Front-End.

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **UI/UX Design**.

---

## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- **Fintech applications**,
- **E-commerce platforms**,
- **Cloud service interfaces**,
- and others.

So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### React

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2022 ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2022} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Next.js

I've been using CRA for a few years, but since discovering Next.js, I don't think I would want to use any other web framework. **It's just that good!**

### TypeScript

First of all, the programming language. I'm very used to using **TypeScript**, although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc.

The JavaScript superset—TypeScript—has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2023} years**.

### Ant Design

I have extensive experience with Ant Design, having used it for several enterprise-level applications. I've customized Ant Design components to match design requirements while maintaining their functionality and accessibility.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been using SCSS for a longer time ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2023} years).

**I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

My experience includes:

- Creating reusable component libraries based on Ant Design
- Implementing complex form systems with validation
- Building responsive admin dashboards and control panels
- Customizing themes and styling to match brand guidelines
- Optimizing Ant Design performance for large-scale applications

### Framer Motion

For animations, I am more comfortable using Framer Motion. Creating animations using JavaScript has **never been as easy as using Framer Motion**.

### GSAP

I have experience with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for creating high-performance animations. GSAP provides excellent browser compatibility and smooth animations, making it perfect for:

- Complex timeline-based animations
- Performance-critical animations and interactions
- ScrollTrigger animations for scroll-based effects
- Morphing SVG animations
- Advanced easing and motion effects

GSAP's robust API and excellent performance make it an excellent choice for professional web animations.

### WebSocket

I have extensive experience implementing real-time features using WebSocket technology. I've worked on:

- Real-time notification systems for enterprise applications
- Live data monitoring dashboards with instant updates
- Collaborative editing interfaces with real-time synchronization
- Chat functionality with message status indicators
- Connection management with automatic reconnection handling
- Optimizing WebSocket performance for production environments

This experience allows me to build responsive applications that provide users with immediate feedback and up-to-date information.

### Git

I have strong version control skills using Git, which is essential for team collaboration and project management. My Git experience includes:

- Managing feature branches with Git Flow and GitHub Flow workflows
- Resolving merge conflicts and performing code reviews
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Creating and managing Pull/Merge Requests
- Performing complex operations like rebasing, cherry-picking, and bisecting
- Using Git hooks for pre-commit validation and code quality enforcement
- Maintaining clean commit history with proper commit messages

These skills allow me to collaborate effectively in team environments and maintain high code quality standards.

### Jira

I'm proficient with Jira for project management and issue tracking

### Azure

I have experience working with Microsoft Azure cloud services for development
